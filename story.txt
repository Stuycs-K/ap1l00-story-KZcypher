Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <coins>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <part>, I thought I would <forget> about
a little and see the <paultry> part of the <game>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<word> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <thoughts>;
whenever it is a <solemn>, <sad> November in my <pencil>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
run> before coffin <wood>, and bringing up the rear of every <tree> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <boring>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <regulate> into the <computer>, and methodically
<replace> people's <pens> off—then, I account it high time to get to <TV> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <noun> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <tea> with me.
